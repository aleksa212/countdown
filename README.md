This project is created for practice purposes. The user is presented with a form in which he can enter a name and pick a date in the future. After the user submits the form, the countdown to the specified date starts. After countdown reaches 0, 'countdown complete' message will be displayed.

This project helped me practice working with dates and localStorage, as well as forms and user input.
